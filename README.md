AriKeys Redux is a fork of the original [AriKeys](https://github.com/ASangarin/AriKeys) by ASangarin.
The main idea of this fork is to make it work in newest verions of Minecraft, mainly 1.20.4.

For now I'll be only focused on Fabric 1.20.4, if this... Somehow, gets to more people I will try to port it to forge and maybe a couple more versions of Minecraft.

## Installation:
- **Fabric**
1. Install [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/)
2. Download [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and put it in your mods folder.
3. Download [AriKeysRedux](https://github.com/NerfOscar/AriKeys-Redux/releases) (Fabric) and put it in your mods folder

## Usage:
AriKeys Redux must be used alongside a server running the AriKeysReduxPlugin (Not existent at the moment)
When joining such a server, it will send the configured keybinds to your client and you will be able to see and change keybindings from the game menu.
